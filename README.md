### Productivity & Organization

  * **[Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)**
    This is the ultimate Windows utility suite. Seriously, just get it. It bundles a bunch of tiny, powerful tools into one package.

      * **PowerToys Run:** The Windows version of macOS Spotlight. Hit `Alt + Space` to get a universal search bar that finds apps, files, and does quick math.
      * **FancyZones:** A next-level window manager. Define your own screen layouts and snap windows into them with a key press. Way more powerful than the default snap.
      * **Color Picker:** A system-wide color eyedropper. Hit `Win + Shift + C` to pull the hex code (or RGB, HSL, etc.) from anything on your screen.
      * **Awake:** A tiny utility in your system tray to keep your PC from falling asleep on command. Perfect for long downloads or renders.
      * **Text Extractor:** Basically a built-in OCR. Hit `Win + Shift + T` to select any text on your screen (even from images or videos) and copy it to your clipboard.

  * **[Microsoft To Do](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://todo.microsoft.com/)**
    A sleek and simple to-do list, task manager, and reminder app. It syncs with your Microsoft account and has a great "My Day" feature to keep you from getting overwhelmed.

  * **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**
    Your "second brain." It's a note-taking app that uses local Markdown files. You can link notes together to create a personal wiki. It's free for personal use and insanely powerful for students or anyone doing research. (also money thirsty)

  * **[Ditto Clipboard Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH3ZBJQ)**
    Windows' built-in clipboard history (`Win + V`) is okay, but Ditto is on another level. It saves a massive, searchable history of everything you copy (text, images, links) and lets you access it with a simple hotkey. Really good if you don't have malware on your pc.

### File Management & Search

  * **[Files App](https://files.community/)**
    The File Explorer replacement that just fits Windows 11. It has tabs, a dual-pane view, tagging, custom themes (Mica\!), and a much smoother, more modern interface. It just makes managing files feel *good*.

  * **[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)**
    This tool does one thing and does it perfectly: it finds any file or folder on your PC *instantly*. It's light-years faster than the built-in Windows search. Once you use it, you can't go back. 

  * **[QuickLook](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NV4BS3L1H4S)**
    Another killer macOS feature for Windows. Select *any* file in File Explorer (an image, PDF, audio file, zip, doc), hit the `Spacebar`, and get an instant preview.

  * **[ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)**
    This is way more than a "simple" screenshot tool; it's the most powerful one out there, and it's free. It can capture any region, window, or scrolling page, record GIFs, and then *automatically* run tasks like adding a watermark, uploading it to Imgur, and copying the link to your clipboard.

### System Utilities & Enhancements

  * **[EarTrumpet](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH516XP)**
    The volume mixer Windows *should* have had. It replaces the default sound icon and lets you control the volume for every single app individually, right from your taskbar.

### Visuals & UI Customization

  * **[Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/)**
    Your one-stop shop for deep-level Windows customization. It's a modding platform that lets you tweak tiny details of the OS without messing with system files.

      * **Recommended mods:**
          * **Better file sizes in Explorer details:** Shows file sizes as KB, MB, or GB instead of just KB.
          * **Windows 11 Taskbar Styler:** Get a translucent, blurred, or dock-like taskbar.
          * **Windows 11 Start Menu Styler:** Make your Start menu translucent or blur the background.
          * **Windows 11 Notification Center Styler:** Matches your notification center to your Start menu theme.

  * **[ModernFlyouts](https://modernflyouts-community.github.io/)**
    Replaces those ugly, old-school volume/brightness/media pop-ups from Windows 8 with slick, modern, and theme-able ones that match the Windows 11 design.

  * **[RoundedTB](https://github.com/RoundedTB/RoundedTB)**
    A simple tool that lets you add margins and rounded corners to your taskbar, turning it into a sleek "dock" that floats at the bottom of your screen. (You can grab it from the Microsoft Store, too\!)

  * **[Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/)**
    The king of animated and interactive wallpapers. It costs a few bucks on Steam but has a massive Workshop library with endless options, from 3D-rendered scenes to audio-reactive visualizers.

  * **[Lively Wallpaper](https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/)**
    The best *free* and open-source alternative to Wallpaper Engine. It's powerful, looks great, and can even set websites or GIFs as your wallpaper. You can find it on its website or the Microsoft Store.
