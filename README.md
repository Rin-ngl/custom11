- [**Files App** by Files Community](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NGHP3DX8HDX?hl=en-us&gl=SK&ocid=pdpshare), can be found on the Microsoft Store. This app is an replacement for the Explorer Application as it has some major improvement like making the scrolling actually good not look like a console from the 2000s. Allows to have two tabs open at once, so no need for switching between them. Archiving support. Custom themes, Mica alt. Column view. Tags, allows for sexy organization. Just has some great improvements from the Explorer App.

### Theme customizations
- [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/), customize almost every aspect of your computer with this one app
  - Recommended mods on Windhawk
  - **Better file sizes in Explorer details**; makes Explorer show sizes in the most appropriate sizes KB for KB files, MB for MB, GB and TB instead of all of them being in KB.
  - **Windows 11 Taskbar Styler**; Want translucent taskbar? sure. Want your taskbar to look like ur running WinXP, sure. My favorite is DockLike, but there are many more.
  - **Windows 11 Start Menu Styler**; Allows you to style your start menu easily, no coding just like on the taskbar choose a syle, my favorite is TranslucentStartMenu.
  - **Windows 11 Notification Center Styler**; Style your Notification center with some lovely Themes, I would recommend going with TranslucentShell which goes perfectly with TranslucentStartMenu.
  > There are many more, but these are my favorites.

### Animated Wallpaper
- [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/), one of the best app for animated wallpapers, but it cost 5 bucks.
- [Sucrose Wallpaper Engine](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8JGPBHTJGLCQ?hl=en-US&gl=SK&ocid=pdpshare), a good free alternative.
